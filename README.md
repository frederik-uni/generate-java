This project creates java files based on a uml class diagram syntax. ?! stands for getters and setters. cse overids clone, tostring and cmp. the rest should be uml

Its for saving time creating files, methods and variables
```
TestClass:cse
?!id: int,!?name:String,!?desc:ArrayList<String>
#name(id: int):void,name(id: int, id2: int):int,-name2(id: int, id2: int):int
```
